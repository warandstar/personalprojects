random_box is about simulating the following problem:
There are n (number) boxes and there are blue and red balls. Each box has different number of each blue and red balls with fixed number of n; so "first" box has 0 red balls, "second" box has 1 red ball, ..., and "nth" box has n red balls.
We randomly pick the box out of n number of boxes and then we randomly pick the ball with that chosen box.
What is probability of choosing red ball by doing such step?
My guess is 50% as there certainly about n/2 red balls, so the fact that we are choosing random box is a misguiding fact.
